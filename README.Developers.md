# Developers notes

## Building the code

To compile the Echessd into a single executable file use:

    $ make

If all you want is to obtain Erlang byte code (*.beam) then use:

    $ make compile

## Building documentation

You can obtain autogenerated HTML documentation with:

    $ make html

Then you'll find it in the 'doc' directory.
